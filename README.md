# Code Splitting

### Learning Objectives

After this session, attendees should be able to:
* explain the use-case and benefits of code-splitting
* use dynamic imports to dynamically import code as needed
* explain what treeshaking is, and why the benefits of dynamic imports can easily be lost when code imported in a non-lazy manner elsewhere in the app.

### "The Heck is Code-Splitting? Sounds painful."


> Code splitting is the splitting of code into various bundles or components which can then be loaded on demand or in parallel.

> As an application grows in complexity or is maintained, CSS and JavaScripts files or bundles grow in byte size, especially as the number and size of included third-party libraries increases. To prevent the requirement of downloading ginormous files, scripts can be split into multiple smaller files. Then features required at page load can be downloaded immediately with additional scripts being lazy loaded after the page or application is interactive, thus improving performance. While the total amount of code is the same (and perhaps even a few bytes larger), the amount of code needed during initial load can be reduced.

### Common Use Cases That We See In Jupiter

1. routes in a single-page app
1. long pages (why load the whole page when you can load and render as-needed?)

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
